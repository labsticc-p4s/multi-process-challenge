Expected Contributions

The special issue invites submission responding to a process modeling challenge, which is an updated version of the challenge used in MULTI 2019/2020 [3]. The challenge establishes requirements for a process representation defined at an abstract process-definition level and at various more concrete domain-specific levels, resulting in a multi-level hierarchy of related models. The abstract process-definition level should be reusable across domains and its constraints must be respected by the domain-specific levels. Solutions employing Multi-Level Modeling techniques and/or other process modeling techniques (such as flexible process modeling [5], ontology-based process modeling) are welcome.

Each challenge response will be reviewed against the following criteria:

    Does the response address the established domain as described in the challenge description and demonstrate the use of modeling features?
    Does it evaluate/discuss its proposed modeling solution against the criteria described in the challenge description?
    Does it discuss the merits and limitations of the employed modeling technique?
    Authors are invited to suggest further requirements to demonstrate particular benefits of the approaches they adopt.

All responders are expected to conduct a thorough evaluation of their solutions. Authors of challenge responses to MULTI 2019/2020 are welcome to extend their previous solutions into in-depth challenge response papers (ensuring over 30% of novel material).
