\cite{multiProcessChallenge2019}

\emph{Submissions responding to the challenge should describe
a multi-level model conforming to the case description,
including justifications for non-trivial design decisions. In
order to foster comparability between solutions, respondents
are asked to make sure that concepts of the case description
are explicitly represented by one or more model elements.}\\

\emph{criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the response address the established domain as described in the challenge description and demonstrate the use of modeling features?
    \item Does it evaluate/discuss its proposed modeling solution against the criteria described in the challenge description?
    \item Does it discuss the merits and limitations of the employed modeling technique?
    Authors are invited to suggest further requirements to demonstrate particular benefits of the approaches they adopt.
\end{enumerate}
